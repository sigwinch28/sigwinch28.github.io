Britannia is a withered old hag and her robes lay in tatters before her children.

The once-United Kingdom of once-Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a culturally empty and demented husk of disinterested, dysfunctional, and apathetic individuals.

We are isles of *"Customers are reminded"* passive voice announcements which serve as reminders of dodged liability, not concern of wellbeing for our fellow resident.
We are an archipelago where the prospect of doing one's self-selected job is a novelty rarely seen in practice.
In a grand strike of irony it brings pleasure to the disillusioned eyes to witness something done properly or with even a crumb of care.

We write *"Have a nice day!"* on single-use petroleum-based coffee cups and we simultaneously tut at a dropped apple core.
We think of ourselves great and mighty, but the streets of our capital city are awash with refuse sacks because while we ruled the world with a cruel iron fist, we are incapable of dominating our own streets with a small flotilla of Biffa bins.
We are not mighty in anything except our delusion of being mighty.
For our delusion alone, we stand alone leagues above the shoulders of our fellow nations.

We surrender our rights to private lives under the populist scaremongering of the protection of children while the ruling classes and the celebrities torture our young in full view and knowledge of those who should be protecting them.
We exist in a police state of recorded communications, telltale baking systems, and facial recognition cameras which scream of a technological dystopia.
However, theft from a person will get you only a crime reference number, not a police officer.
For crime reference numbers are free and police are expensive.
Today seeing a police officer on the beat is like watching *Punch and Judy*: a historically violent institution usually only seen at busy places that's worth pointing out to your children because of the times you had fond memories of seeing them much more often.
If we're going to live in a police state, at least catch the criminals that the state claims exist.

We live in a system where the bureaucracy values its own time and efforts because the machine must be fed and the gears must turn.
They turn slowly, but the machine believes that they must turn.
The institutions expect you to wait by your telephone or at your door like a pavlovian hound for their wheels to turn at some point during nine in the morning and four in the afternoon, plus two hours for lunch.
The human capital of these instutitions is simultaneously scarce and expensive, but that has not shocked these institutions into action which would zap even the most sloth-like private sector into action for fear of insolvency.
Of course, that were unless such an entity operated in a private sector too important to the gear-turning to fail.
A wiser machine would have sought to allow the citizenry to arrange its own appointments or serve itself digitally as was the dream near why-two-kay, but shoddily-written contracts and corrupt blind eyes have led to many miscarriages of justice because of "computer said no".

The idea of someone doing their job as they are paid to do is now an alien concept in our everyday lives.
Everyone is now a customer and now nobody is a person.

The machine expects that your time is pointless and that you are somehow always free for them when they need you, but in contradictory fashion they expect you to be working hard to prevent the three-fold guarantee that the boomers will have their money, that they will have their property, and that the generations that came after them are well and truly buggered.

To view the absurdity of this self-concocted situation all we must do is go somewhere quiet.
To listen to the waves, to listen to the breeze in the grasses, or to listen to what's left of nature as the birds call for mates.
All we need to do is literally touch grass and the house of bureaucratic and self-important cards shows its pustule-covered and hairy bare arse for what it is.

There is no dream, there is no hope, but somehow there is mindless optimism that we somehow exist in a good timeline.

We do not.

The UK is simply fucked.
