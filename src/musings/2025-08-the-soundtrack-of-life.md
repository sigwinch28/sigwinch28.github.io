I was watching a film this evening.
There was a scene towards the opening where a '90s pop song was playing.
It was high energy and really helped me feel that something fun and interesting was going to happen in the film.

But then it suddenly stopped as the shot changed.
It served a purpose to me.
I felt like we feel that life has this soundtrack, but it doesn't.
We imagine that life has this momentum and energy to it, but it doesn't.
It's mostly quiet.
